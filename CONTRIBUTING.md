# Contributing to Simplecrawler

Simplecrawler has benefited enormously from the welcome contributions and
assistance of many generous developers over the years, and contributions, ideas,
and questions into all aspects of Simplecrawler's development are always
welcome.

Before you file a PR or an issue though, please ensure your contribution adheres
to these simple guidelines â€” it'll make life much easier for both you and the
Simplecrawler project maintainers!

- Test with the latest version of Simplecrawler from GitHub
- Reduce your problem to a test case that can be reproduced by the maintainers
- Try to write a clear and short issue description
- If you're filing a PR, run `npm test` before opening it to catch linting or test issues
- If you're changing the `README`, remember that it's generated (and you can regenerate it by running `npm run docs`)
